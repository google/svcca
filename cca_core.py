"""
The core code for applying Canonical Correlation Analysis to deep networks.

This module contains the core functions to apply canonical correlation analysis
to deep neural networks. The main function is get_cca_similarity, which takes in
two sets of activations, typically the neurons in two layers and their outputs
on all of the datapoints D = [d_1,...,d_m] that have been passed through.

Inputs have shape (num_neurons1, m), (num_neurons2, m). This can be directly
applied used on fully connected networks. For convolutional layers, the 3d block
of neurons can either be flattened entirely, along channels, or alternatively,
the dft_ccas (Discrete Fourier Transform) module can be used.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05806 for full details.
